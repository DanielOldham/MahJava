<h2>Goals</h2>

The project was created to demonstrate knowledge of Java GUI concepts and the ability to solve logical design problems using OOP tools such as inheritance and polymorphism.

<h2>Key learnings</h2>

- Java inheritance concepts such as use of `super` keyword and method overriding
- Java polymorphism concepts
- High-level GUI concepts such as event handling
- Java GUI tools such as JFrame, JPanel, JOptionPane, etc.
- Connection between GUI and Business logic
- Logical problem solving and critical thinking necessary to take an abstract/high-level goal (puzzle game) and create different Java classes to implement it
